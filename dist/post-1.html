        <p>Hello to all wandering souls on the internet. This is the very beginning of the Four Cylinder. It is an
          independent game studio that consists one guy. Yeah, at this point, it’s (mostly) just me.</p>
        <p>My name is Deniz and apart from this blog, website, and social media stuff, I do the design, coding and art
          of the game. I got help from my friends from time to time (which is why I still manage to keep my sanity) but
          everyone is busy with their life struggles right now (being millennial is sucks) and as things got some
          momentum, hopefully some of them will get on the ship for real. I will do the announcements here when the
          crew expanded.</p>
        <p>The very first game of this studio will be “Speculator’s Playground”. It is simply a forex trading game with
          some RPG elements on it. The goal is to be rich, dominate the markets, and be even more rich. The game ends
          when you decide you got enough money. Hopefully, by playing this game you also get some insight about forex
          trading in real life as well. Because of the design and the scope of the game, it will be released on mobile
          devices. It will be free-to-play and probably contain some in app purchases. It is still early for giving a
          release date but it will probably take few months until release.</p>
        <p>So, I think this is end of the first ever blog post. Welcome to this bandwagon and hopefully you will stick
          around. Don’t forget to check out the icons below and follow the social media accounts as well ( I probably
          won’t spam your feed but no promises).</p>
        <p>See you on the next post.</p>
